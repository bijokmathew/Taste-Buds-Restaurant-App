## Development

* The project was developed with the help agile methodology. During the design process collect the project requirements and write epics broken down into user stories with well defined acceptance criteria and tasks list. Based on the priority move those user stories in to different project sprint cycle like First cycle, Second cycle and Third Cycle in order to achieve MNP.Once finished the user stories moved those stories into closed state and if all issues related to the sprint closed then move the sprint cycle also in to closed state. During the development time got an enhancement ideas, create stories and moved in to backlog with priorities.

        1: Open elephantsql.com site.

        2: create a new instance and select plan and region.
        
        3: Copy the database url from the created database instance.

        4: In heroku, add 'DATABASE_URL' Config Vars with copied database url string.

        5: Create a env.py file within the project and use the copied database url to create a DATABASE_URL environment variable. The Python OS module will be required for this to run the project locally from gitpod.

        *The env.py file is used to protect keys which should only be viewed by the developer. This file will not be pushed to GutHub for public display.*

    ---
    
    * STAGE THREE - Create a SECRET_KEY

        1: Within the env.py file, create a SECRET_KEY environment variable. The string for this variable is decided by the developer.

        2: On the settings tab of the Heroku app, reveal config vars and add the SECRET_KEY variable along with the corresponding string.

    ---
    
    * STAGE FOUR - Update the settings.py file

        1: Import dj_database_url and env.py into the settings.py file within the project.

            import dj_database_url
            if os.path.isfile('env.py'):
                import env

        2: Update the default SECRET_KEY variable provided by Django to the SECRET_KEY environment variable.

            SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')

        3: Using an if/else statement update the DATABASES dictionary for the deployed project to use the DATABASE_URL environment variable, the dj_database_url library is utilized here.

            if development:
                DATABASES = {
                    'default': {
                        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                        'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
                    }
                }
            else:
                DATABASES = {
                    'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
            }
        
        *The database for developing the project remains as the sqlite one provided*

        4: Preform a migration.

        *The Heroku database is now being used as the backend, within the resources tab of the app, the Heroku Postgres link will bring up a window demonstrating this.*

    ---

    * STAGE FIVE - Connect app to Cloudinary

        * Create a Cloudinary account.*

        1: On the Cloudinary website, copy the API environment variable string.

        2: Within the projects env.py file create a CLOUDINARY_URL environment variable equal to this copied string.

        3: Within the Heroku app, on the settings tab, update the config vars to contain this variable.

        *For initial deployment, a variable called DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC is also created within the config vars at this point with a value of 1, this is simply to get the skeleton project deployed for testing purposes and removed when deploying the completed project*

        4: Within the Heroku app, on the settings tab, add 'PORT' config var with value '8000'.

        4: Within the settings.py file on the project, under INSTALLED_APPS, 'cloudinary_storage' and 'cloudinary' must be added.

        5: Django must then be told to use Cloudinary to store media and static files, this is done by adding the below variables to the relevant section of the settings.py file:
            
            STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'
            STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')]
            STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
            MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
            DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
        
        *The app is now linked to Cloudinary*
    
    ---
     
    * STAGE SIX - Tell Django where the templates are stored

        1: Under the BASE_DIR on settings.py, add in the below templates directory. 
        
            TEMPLATES_DIR =  os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')
        
        2: Then within the TEMPLATES setting, update the DIRS key to point towards this variable.

            'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR]
    
    ---
    
    * STAGE SEVEN - Update ALLOWED_HOSTS
        
        1: Create 'DEVELOPMENT' variable with value True in env.py file

        2: In setting.py try to assign the 'DEVELOPMENT' value from env, if it is no defined then assign value as False
           
           development = os.environ.get('DEVELOPMENT', False)

        3: At this point, within settings.py, set the DEBUG variable to development.

        4: Using an if/else statement update the ALLOWED_HOSTS variable for the deployed project to be the name of your Heroku app with ".herokuapp.com" appended to the end.

            DEBUG = development

            if development:
                ALLOWED_HOSTS = [
                    'localhost',
                ]
            else:
                ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['taste-buds-restaurantapp.herokuapp.com']

        *For development the host is set to localhost, so that the project can be ran locally. This is also a good point to add the Media, Static and Template directories, these folders should be added at the top level.*
    
    ---
    
    * STAGE EIGHT - Create a Procfile

        1: Create a Procfile at the top level of the directory.

        2: Within this file, declare the below command. This command ensures gunicorn is used as the web server.

            web: gunicorn tastebuds.wsgi
        
        *Add, commit and push to the repository at this point*
    
    ---
    
    * STAGE NINE - Connect the GitHub repository to the Heroku App

        1: Within the Deploy tab on the Heroku app, choose GitHub as the deployment method.

        2: Search for the correct repository and connect.

        3: At the bottom of the deployment section there is an option to chose which branch to deploy. Chose the main branch and allow the build log to complete.

        4: Once complete, chose to allow automatic deployment from here onwards.

        *The app has now been deployed successfully. The live link can be found here - [Taste-Buds-Restaurant-App](https://taste-buds-restaurantapp.herokuapp.com/)*

        **B, from this point onwards, all changes made to the database in development will have to be migrated to the deployed database separately in order to take effect. This can be done by changing the DATABASES dictionary in the settings.py file to point directly at the heroku database, DO NOT commit to GitHub with this setting saved.**
